# Domain contract test templates

Generate an illustrative xUnit project to explore the
[reconstruction cases](../../standards/contract-cases.md). The examples help
targets design their own tests and choose their domain contracts and APIs.

## Package-free domain example

The six cases cover replay without pending events, confirmation of new facts,
reconstruction of a Plan with nested state, and rejection of absent, incomplete
or unsupported histories. The generated project includes self-contained
illustrative domain code and uses xUnit and BDDfy. Discard a partially restored
instance after replay fails. The optional CT-005 example verifies the published
API's stronger replay guards.

From a shell with the .NET 10 SDK, select this template directory in the
source or installed knowledge package. Generate into a new disposable directory
with an isolated native template hive.

```powershell
$templateRoot = (Resolve-Path '<knowledge-root>/templates/domain-contracts').Path
$work = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path (
    Join-Path ([IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "aicf-domain-contracts-$([Guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N'))")
$hive = Join-Path $work.FullName 'hive'
$output = Join-Path $work.FullName 'package-free'

dotnet new install $templateRoot --debug:custom-hive $hive
dotnet new aicf-domain-contract-tests --name Sample.DomainContracts --output $output --debug:custom-hive $hive
dotnet test (Join-Path $output 'Sample.DomainContracts.csproj') -c Release
```

## Optional published ArchPrecept CT-005 example

This template exercises the lifecycle of the fixed
[CT-005 API](https://github.com/YuChia-Wei/ArchPrecept/blob/fdc1f9ff3934c769047f797803abc8614290e889/docs/product/event-sourcing-contract.md)
and [ES implementation](https://github.com/YuChia-Wei/ArchPrecept/blob/fdc1f9ff3934c769047f797803abc8614290e889/src/Contracts/ArchPrecept.Contracts.Domain.EventSourcing/EsAggregateRoot.cs).
The three cases cover committed state after replay, confirmation of a pending
batch, and rejection of reuse after failed replay. The append outcome is
represented by the caller's confirmation step. Event-store atomicity and
transport recovery are outside these cases.

Use the .NET 8 runtime and supply the exact published assemblies from
ArchPrecept.Contracts.Domain and ArchPrecept.Contracts.Domain.EventSourcing
`0.0.3-preview`. The [owner's release record](https://github.com/YuChia-Wei/ArchPrecept/blob/main/docs/releases/0.0.3-preview.md)
records build source `fdc1f9ff3934c769047f797803abc8614290e889` and the following
package digests.

| Exact package | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| ArchPrecept.Contracts.Domain.0.0.3-preview.nupkg | `ceb5c5985a0ee61a00572dc6948ab9b187fe2c6d557249f0482626b0f62e3026` |

The [published build artifact](https://github.com/YuChia-Wei/ArchPrecept/actions/runs/39812215279/artifacts/12441085472)
has ZIP digest `d07b031ee633859b604f007abd20ecca682104f4a723bfb1a9e552cf01712c7b`.
Verify the two packages, preserve their licenses, and extract them into
`domain/` and `eventsourcing/` under an explicit local directory. The generated
project requires both `lib/net8.0` DLLs and restores the test runner dependencies
through ordinary NuGet configuration.

Use the isolated hive registered above.

```powershell
$output = Join-Path $work.FullName 'published-ct005'
$publishedContracts = (Resolve-Path '<verified-extracted-directory>').Path
dotnet new aicf-ct005-contract-tests --name Sample.Ct005Contracts --output $output --debug:custom-hive $hive
dotnet test (Join-Path $output 'Sample.Ct005Contracts.csproj') -c Release "-p:PublishedContractsDir=$publishedContracts"
```
